    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Place the raisins, currants and almonds into a bowl and pour the rum over it. Stir and set aside.</li>
      <li>In another small bowl, add yeast and 2tbsp sugar to milk. Let sit in a warm place for 10-15 minutes until frothy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, add flour, remaining sugar, egg, yolks, butter, vanilla, lemon zest, salt, cardamom, nutmeg and cinnamon.</li>
      <li>Using a stand mixer with a dough hook, or a wooden spoon, mix in yeast mixture until it comes together.</li>
      <li>Knead for 7-8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove dough ball, spread a little oil in bowl.</li>
      <li>Replace dough ball, cover bowl with a damp towel and place it in a warm place for 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Punch down dough and add soaked fruit and nut mixture, mixing until combined.</li>
      <strong>note:</strong> if the dough is too wet, add flour until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.
      <li>Turn dough out onto floured work surface and cut in half.</li>
      <li>Press or roll each piece into an oval about 1-inch thick.</li>
      <li>Cut marzipan in half and roll each into a log the length of each piece of dough.</li>
      <li>Gently press the marzipan into the middle of the dough oval and fold the left side of the dough over to cover the marzipan. Fold the right side of the dough over on top of the left side so that the edge sits in the middle of the stollen.</li>
      <li>Pinch and tuck the ends of the stollen to cover the marzipan.</li>
      <li>Use the bottom edge of your hand to press down along the length of the stollen towards the right of the center to create a divot and a hump.</li>
      <li>Place on lined baking sheet and cover loosely before placing somewhere warm for an hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350F and pick off raisins sticking out of dough.</li>
      <li>Bake for 30-40 minutes or until golden. Remove and let sit for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>With a toothpick, poke holes all over the stollen and generously brush with butter. Generously sprinkle with powdered sugar.</li>
      <li>Let cool completely.</li>
      <li>The stollen can be enjoyed now or wrapped tightly and left to ripen in a cool place for two weeks.</li>
